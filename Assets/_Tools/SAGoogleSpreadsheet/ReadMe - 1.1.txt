 Features
------------------

This tool can create and generate your game data from Google Spreadsheet into ScriptableObject assets.

Google Spreadsheet is great for game designers to create and store their game data, because it allows
different people working on the same spreadsheet at the same time, and they don't have to worry about
how to use Unity.

It is also great for creating string tables which makes it really easy for localization.

JsonFx is an open source project (https://github.com/jsonfx/jsonfx)
